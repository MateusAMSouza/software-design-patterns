## About the project
Final project of the discipline Laboratory of Software Design at UNIFEI (Federal University of Itajub√°). The goal is to practice concepts from programming (Java) and software 
design patterns. I modeled 20 classes in a UML diagram using at least 2 patterns studied in the subject. 
After that, I implemented the project and an application that instantiates the classes and simulates their behavior in Java using Maven at Eclipse IDE.
The project's theme was Race/People/Ethnicity/Civilizations. As theme, I created an abstraction of the Israeli society during the unified monarchy in the Old Testament.
The 3 patterns used are: 
  1. Singleton - Ark of the Covenant class.
  2. Bridge - Person (abstract parent class for Israeli or Foreign) and Ocupation.
  3. Observer - Ark of the Covenant class and its state being the Ark's location (Israel or other place).

## How to run
To run the program, after clonning, I recommend opening the folder in Eclipse IDE. After this, open the App.java and run.

## Output
The output is a demonstration of program's operation, its classes and interactions. The names inside the code and outputs are in portuguese.
